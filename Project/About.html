		<p>
		Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, 
		California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software,
		and online services. It is considered one of the Big Four of technology along with Amazon, 
		Google, and Facebook. 
		<br><br>
		Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 
		April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, though Wayne sold his 
		share back within 12 days. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, 
		and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs 
		and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went
		public in 1980 to instant financial success. 
		<br><br>
		Over the next few years, Apple shipped new 
		computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984,
		and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However,
		the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles
		between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee, 
		while Jobs and others resigned to found NeXT.

		<p>
		Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. 
		The company's first product is the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak, 
		and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club. Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU,
		RAM, and basic textual-video chips)â€”a base kit concept which would now not be marketed as a complete 
		personal computer. The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,935 in 
		2018 dollars, adjusted for inflation).

		<p>
		Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is a multinational corporation that creates consumer electronics, 
		personal computers, servers, and computer software, and is a digital distributor of media content. The company 
		also has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores. Apple's core product lines are the iPhone smartphone,
		iPad tablet computer, iPod portable media players, and Macintosh computer line. Founders Steve Jobs and Steve 
		Wozniak created Apple Computer on April 1, 1976, and incorporated the company on January 3, 1977, in Cupertino, 
		California.
		<br><br>
		For more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers,
		including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the
		1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1996 after his company NeXT 
		was bought by Apple. The following year he became the company's interim CEO, which later became permanent. Jobs
		subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the
		original iMac in 1998.
		<br><br>
		With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store 
		in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading
		it to drop "Computer" from the company's name in 2007. The company is now also known for its iOS range of smart
		phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and 
		then iPad. As of 30 June 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market 
		capitalization, with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018. Apple's worldwide annual 
		revenue in 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011 and $156 billion in 2012.
